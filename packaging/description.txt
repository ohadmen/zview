 Zview - a general 3d view 
 Zview is designed as a highly efficient tool for visualizing and analyzing 3D point cloud and mesh data, ensuring that the displayed data reflects the actual content stored in a file or memory. By leveraging modern C++ and OpenGL ES, the application is optimized to minimize CPU load and memory consumption, making it a performance-conscious solution for real-time visualization tasks.
 Key features of Zview include the ability to open and handle layered PLY filesâ€”special PLY files containing multiple 3D models, organized in a hierarchical structure with layer names. This layered approach allows users to efficiently manage complex datasets, such as large point clouds segmented into different components or levels of detail.
 Furthermore, Zview is designed with extensibility in mind, offering APIs in C++, Python, and (work-in-progress) support for Matlab and GDB. These APIs enable developers to inject point cloud data directly into Zview from external applications or during debugging sessions via inter-process communication (IPC). This feature is particularly useful for integrating Zview into workflows that require real-time or interactive visualization of dynamically generated data, such as robotics, 3D scanning, or machine learning pipelines.
 In essence, Zview strikes a balance between high performance, flexible data input options, and support for complex file structures, catering to a wide range of professional and research-based 3D visualization needs.
